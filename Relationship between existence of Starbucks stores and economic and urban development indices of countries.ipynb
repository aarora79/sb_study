    "Starbucks Corporation is an American coffee company and coffeehouse chain with more than 24,000 stores across the world. This projects intends to explore the following data science problems:\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about Starbucks store locations for example geographical distribution of stores by country, region, ownership model, brand name etc.\n",
    "2. Find a relationship between Starbucks data with various economic and human development indices such as GDP, ease of doing business, rural to urban population ratio, literacy rate, revenue from tourist inflow and so on.\n",
    "3. Predict which countries where Starbucks does not have a store today are most suitable for having Starbucks stores (in other words in which country where Starbucks does not have a presence should Starbucks open its next store and how many).\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is important because it attempts to provide a model (using Starbucks as an example) which can be applied to any similar business (say in the food and hospitality industry) to predict where it could expand globally. It provides insight about where the business is located currently by bringing out information like say the total number of stores (48) found in the entire continent of Africa is way less than number of stores (184) found just on U.S. Airports."

    "The data used as part of this project is obtained from two sources.\n",
    "1. Starbucks store location data is available from https://opendata.socrata.com via an API. The Socrate Open Data API (SODA) end point for this data is https://opendata.socrata.com/resource/xy4y-c4mk.json\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The economic and urban development data for various countries is available from the World Bank(WB) website. WB APIs are described here https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information. The API end point for all the World Development Indicators (WDI) is http://api.worldbank.org/indicators?format=json. Some examples of indicators being collected include GDP, urban to rural population ratio, % of employed youth (15-24 years), international tourism receipts (as % of total exports), ease of doing business and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible directions/hypothesis based on collected data (this is not the complete list, would be expanded as the project goes on):\n",
    "1. EDA about Starbucks store locations (for example):\n",
    " - What percentage of stores exists in high income, high literacy, high urban to rural population ratio European countries Vs say high population, rising GDP, low urban to rural population Asian countries.\n",
    " - Distribution of stores across geographies based on type of ownership (franchisee, joint venture etc.), brand name etc.\n",
    " - Which country, which city has the most Starbucks stores per 1000 people.\n",
    " - Is there a Starbucks always open at any UTC time during a 24hour period i.e. you can always find some Starbucks store open time at any given time somewhere in some timezone around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data visualization of the Starbucks store data:\n",
    " - World map showing starbucks locations around the world.\n",
    " - Heat map of the world based on the number of Starbucks store in a country.\n",
    " - Frequency distribution of Starbucks store by city in a given country. Does this distribution resemble any wellll known statistical distribution.\n",
    " - Parallel coordinates based visualization for number of stores combined with economic and urban development indicators.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Machine learning model for predicting number of Starbucks store based on various economic and urban development indicators. This could then be used to predict which countries where Starbucks does not have a presence today would be best suited as new markets. For example, model the number of Starbucks location in a country based on a) ease of doing business, b) GDP, c) urban to rural population, d) employment rate between people in the 15-24year age group, e) type of government, f) access to 24hour electricity and so on and so forth.\n",
